33-Bikes
========

33 Bikes is a simple twitter hack to post the capacity of the TFL Barclays Bike rack on Farringdon Lane (Near 33 Digital), using abraham's twitteroauth script (https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth/)

It's dead simple to use... Upload these on to a server, set our secret keys etc., change the station number and you're away!

Next step is to make it find the station number, as stations keep changing their id...
